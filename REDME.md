# Minesweeper ðŸŽ®

A simple **Minesweeper game** built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project is a learning exercise to practice DOM manipulation, object-oriented programming, and game logic implementation in JavaScript.

## Features
- Classic Minesweeper grid-based gameplay.
- Left-click to reveal cells.
- Right-click to place/remove flags.
- Automatic reveal of empty neighbors.
- Win/lose conditions with restart option.

## How It Works
- The **Game** class:

- The **Cell** class:
  - Represents each square on the grid.
  - Knows if it is a mine, revealed, or flagged.
  - Handles click interactions.

## Goals of This Project
- Practice **object-oriented design** in JavaScript.
- Improve understanding of Javascript
- Create a working game with **minimal code and no libraries**.
