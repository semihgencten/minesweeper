# Minesweeper ðŸŽ®

A simple **Minesweeper game** built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project is a learning exercise to practice DOM manipulation, object-oriented programming, and game logic implementation in JavaScript.

- Classic Minesweeper grid-based gameplay.
- Left-click to reveal cells.
