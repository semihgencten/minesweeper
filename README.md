# Minesweeper ðŸŽ®

A simple **Minesweeper game** built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project is a learning exercise to practice DOM manipulation, object-oriented programming, and game logic implementation in JavaScript.

## How to run on a local environment
1. in a terminal run the command "python -m http.server 8000"

## How It Works
The game is built with a modular, object-oriented design:
  Game class â†’ Controls the overall game flow, initializes the grid, manages win/lose logic, and tracks progress.
  Cell class â†’ Represents each grid cell, handling its state (hidden, revealed, flagged, or mined) and rendering.
  Animation/Effects module â†’ Keeps visual effects (like confetti) separate from the core logic.
  
This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, extend, and debug.
The Game handles rules, the Cell handles behavior, and animations stay independent of gameplay logic.

## Goals of This Project
- Practice **object-oriented design** in JavaScript.
- Improve understanding of Javascript
- Create a working game with **minimal code and no libraries**.

---

## Next Improvements
- Add a timer and score tracking.
- Add animations for a smoother experience.
- Make it mobile-friendly.
